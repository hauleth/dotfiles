Dotfiles
========

It is repository of my config files, created as backup in case of UFO/armageddon
or (which is less probably) loosing my data.

You can feel free to use it for yourself, and even contribute if you want. Just
suggest something in [issues](https://github.com/hauleth/dotfiles/issues) or
create pull request (no link because if you need it, I rather won't accept your
pull request).

Installation
------------

Installation easy (but easier way will come in future):

1. Clone whole repo

        $ git clone https://github.com/hauleth/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles

2. Run

        $ make -s
