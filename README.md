Dotfiles
========

It is repository of my config files, created as backup in case of UFO/armaggedon or
(which is less propably) loosing my data.

You can feel free to use it for yourself, and even contributte if you want. Just suggest
something in [issues](https://github.com/hauleth/dotfiles/issues) or create pull request
(no link because if you need it, I rather won't accept your pull request).
